    me not, in mournful numbers,<br>
    Life is but an empty dream!—<br>
    For the soul is dead that slumbers,<br>
    And things are not what they seem.

            1. Now that’s what I call stupid: In my junior year of high school, this guy asked me on a date.<sup><a
                href="LIFE.HTML">[2]</a></sup>.
            He rented a
            Redbox movie and made a pizza. We were watching the movie and the oven beeped so the pizza was done. He
            looked
            me
            dead in the eye and said, “This is the worst part.” I then watched this boy open the oven and pull the pizza
            out
            with his bare hands, rack and all, screaming at the top of his lungs. We never had a second date.

            2. The fake report card: <P></P>I failed the first quarter of a class in middle school, so I made a fake
            report
            card. I did this every quarter that year. I forgot that they mail home the end-of-year cards, and my mom got
            it
            before I could intercept with my fake. She was
            <section>
              <h5><B>PISSED</B></h5>—at the school for their error. The
              teacher
              also retired that year and had already thrown out his records so they had to take my mother’s “proof” (the
              fake
              ones I made throughout the year) and “correct” the “mistake.”
              I’ve never told her the truth.<P></P>
